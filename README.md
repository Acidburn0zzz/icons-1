# elementary Icons
elementary icons is an original set of vector icons designed specifically for elementary OS and its desktop environment: Pantheon.

[Design Guidelines](https://elementary.io/docs/human-interface-guidelines#iconography)

## Not a General Purpose Icon Set
Since this set is designed specifically for elementary OS, pull requests to add icons or symlinks that are specific to other desktop environments (such as `xfce-*` or `gnome-*` named icons) will be rejected. Use of icon names in line with the [FreeDesktop.Org Icon Naming Specification](http://standards.freedesktop.org/icon-naming-spec/icon-naming-spec-latest.html) is encouraged.

## Preserves 3rd Party Branding
elementary icons does not attempt to supply icons for 3rd party apps. Pull requests to add icons or symlinks that would overwrite the branding of 3rd party apps will be rejected

## Openly Licensed
Redistributing, Forking, Remixing, etc are encouraged! These icons are licensed under the terms of the GNU General Public License as outlined in the included COPYING file. If you feel the desire to compensate the artists who maintain these icons for your usage, [please see this page](https://elementary.io/get-involved#funding) and thank you!
